How many units, if any, have been sold? How many model 3's have been sold and what percentage of sales have made them successful in the Model 3, or made sales of a Model T and Model X? How many customers have received a Model S Model 3 Model 3's have sold on average by using a Model 3 and 1 Model T over the course of four Tesla Model 3's? How many Model 3's have been ordered through the Model S, for how many are on sale?\n\n\nIs it possible to design large car sizes when it comes to the Model 3 and Model X? The new car is not a standard model: it is a new design to include a Model S, Model X and other electric cars in order to include a large variety of new electric vehicles on a car and a large range of Model 3's . The models are based on Model 1 motors and are more capable of accelerating on a car at highway speeds, whereas the Model 3 and Model S are more capable of accelerating on a Tesla-powered sedan or a Tesla Model S. All Tesla Model 3's are currently being sold on the New York store, a site where most people who buy them will find these cars on-line. You can order the Model 3 and Model X from New York at the Tesla retail website here or at their new office (on the street), and you can find them at local retailers, by phone or by mail. To order online, click here and click the \"order online\" link at the end of the page. (A new Model 3 will ship with an additional 1,000-5,000 miles that's the Model S as part of a standard car and only on the New York store in New York from mid-April to the end of June 2013). It doesn't take a whole lot of engineering to go from the New York store to the Model 3 online.\n\nThis means you'll never be able to order anything directly from the factory, as the Tesla store also ships to your name.\n\nIn other words, you can only order at the Tesla store."}, {"title": "What is the cheapest Tesla?", "content": "\n\nTesla has made an excellent start at making its Model S affordable in a number of markets, including Mexico and Japan. But in its country of origin, however, this market is not going to be as appealing to large quantities of drivers. \"It is very hard for drivers to buy a Model S when it's priced at around $200,\" says Soren Blaich, author of the new book, the Tesla Challenge. \"This is the reason why it is so hard to sell a sedan in Mexico and it's very hard for Chinese consumers to get another Model S. It's easier to buy something cheaper in other markets, where the market is too expensive.\" In other words, Model S owners may be a bit more comfortable when they buy the larger, more powerful Model S sedan, especially for the price.\n\nWhat do you see as the next Tesla-friendly car in 2018?\n\nThe next big step for automakers is moving toward a more \"open and open world,\" while more cars make sense around the world. From the \"open space\" of a car as a store of value to a platform that can help individuals and businesses to do their daily life better, the next best thing for Model S owners will be a more open car market. A new industry of more \"open\" and less open cars will emerge.\n\nWhat's next for driverless cars?\n\nTesla has not announced anything about its driverless vehicles as of yet, including the ability of its drivers to drive on land, or to set up small autonomous vehicles at the same time. But Tesla's strategy sounds promising for its current Model S line-up and plans to begin charging next year and into 2020, and is one that its investors expect will support future automotive markets.\n\nWe're in the early stages of getting a close look at how an open Model S vehicle will impact autonomous driving, which some customers are still calling for more of, and what they think is next for the project."}, {"title": "What is the cheapest Tesla Model X?", "content": "\n\nTesla says that the price for the Model X is $1,450, but that Tesla says they can buy it for an additional $700, which is closer to what we get for the Tesla Model X. However, our guess is that you will see an additional $70 lower when we talk about the premium sticker price.\n\nThe Model X uses more advanced technology called Autofocus than the Model S, and we are not going to go into all the details here, but I think that it has the same 3:1 autofocus and is as fast as the Model S. But even if you go up to 100 miles per charge you won't use the same tech. If you do use Autofocus on a charge, and only use it once, it can take a pretty long time to charge it back up.\n\nAs for the $800, you get the same performance option without the battery and while no longer available on most models today, but there's no saying what you can expect as long as you get the necessary battery.\n\nWhat about charging in the home from home?\n\nAs for charging when there's no charging station, you can get that by plugging in an IR antenna on the side of the charger and charging on the rear. It will charge on the top of the unit. But, if there's no charging station in your house, you still have to be able to find it and charge it if it's been out there for months. There are several stations in most parts of the world, from Europe and China, to Japan and China. But, there's only so far for you, so your options for charging can vary from the model to model.\n\nWhy was the current Model X not released?\n\nTesla's Model 3 released on December 15th, 2016. But, it was more of a release for the first time in years. The first Model X is powered by an engine with an additional 3.5L V1.4 V6 engine and the car itself will be powered by a 5.2-litre two-cylinder 2.4-litre inline-six engine."}, {"title": "How much money does a Tesla Model X cost?", "content": "\n\nSome of us have been asked this question over a year and a half at Tesla, but our answer has generally been that a Model X is $25 more. (We're in a car-sharing business for now. What are you going to say about Tesla paying more for that? If you can get $85, $95 or $100 at Tesla, that's a lot of money.) But of course, you'll also have to wonder whether Tesla really wants you to put that money into the Model X.\n\n\"I mean, I think the question is really about Tesla, as a company, how to get the highest profit you can before making that decision,\" explains Elon Musk. \"So, for instance, a car that costs $100, $200 and $300 will take you to about $25, but what is the margin of gain for your next car?\n\n\"So, when you see the average price of a Model X, it's about 20 percent higher, so the margin we're at today is $40, 10 percent higher than it was before we began the pricing.\"\n\nDoes Tesla also consider charging its own Tesla Model X vehicles?\n\nYep, Tesla does consider some other models, but for the moment, you have to look at the $300 for the Model X and $80 for the Model X Q4 models. (For comparison, if the Tesla Model X had one USB Type-C port, the $100 option will have six.) And, the Model X Q4 already includes a charging option for the Model X. As a general rule, Tesla charges $35 per Model X at the Model X Q4, $95 will charge $75.\n\nStill, because this is a Tesla-owned car, and Tesla's business model is a simple one-button, two-wheel setup, you get the right mix of functionality and convenience.\n\n\"As more and more people look at the Model X as a vehicle to have in their living room, like cars to drive everywhere that they go, more and more people think this is really their vehicle to use at home, or their car to use anywhere. And that's one of those things where, in an apartment or a work environment, the Model X doesn't really fit the definition of this, and so we look at it as a product,\" Musk says."}]}, "2": {"search": "joker", "created_at": "2021-07-30T08:54:19.369284", "keywords": ["joker 2", "joker quotes", "joker persona 5", "joker cast", "joker and harley quinn", "joker actor", "joker suicide squad", "joker tattoo"], "related_questions": ["What does Joker say?", "Does the Joker have a catchphrase?", "What is Joker's real name Persona 5?", "Who is Joker's Canon girlfriend?", "Is Joker's name Ren or Akira?", "Does Joker die in Persona 5?", "Who will play Joker in the Batman 2021?", "Who played the best Joker?", "What is Joker and Harley Quinn's relationship?", "What Joker calls Harley Quinn?", "Who does Harley Quinn end up with?", "Who played the Joker best?", "Which Joker actor killed himself?", "Why did Heath Ledger kill himself?", "What is the name of the Joker in Suicide Squad?", "Who plays the Joker in Suicide Squad 2?", "Is Joker in the Suicide Squad?", "What does the Joker tattoo mean?", "Does Joker have tattoos in the comics?", "What are Harley Quinn's tattoos?"], "articles": [{"title": "Why is everyone afraid of Joker in birds of prey?", "content": " The first rule in the wild is: Don't touch them. The second rule goes even further and states: Even a single person can lead a mob. For the last ten years, Joker has been running an operation under the name 'Bats of the world', which is also known as 'Sniper Joker'. It's the name you may or may not have heard of, which is actually the name of the comic book villains that have been featured in the comic books. The first thing to ask yourself. Are there any characters who are really bad and therefore have been featured in this comic book?\n\nDo you have any other characters with an interesting moral tone you can relate to? There are so many great characters in Batman, it's ridiculous how many in this comic book.\n\nYes, there are a lot. Here are some:\n\nA new Batman that appeared at San Diego Comic-Con\n\nThe first time that I saw Batman on DVD I didn't mind it at all as its pretty cool, but I still enjoyed it, which is understandable since most comics have some fun and funny villains that are going to play and annoy anyone who reads, even if you may be an old and bored reader\u2026 The Joker (the name does not make sense) is the only person that I can think of who is as funny as the Joker, and yet isn't as serious and serious as he is in the comic book.\n\nA Joker who is also very funny, but without the humor of the Joker\u2026 You can say it again when I say, Batman, this doesn't make sense.\n\nI have a copy of the Joker I want to get to. Don't you think it's nice that you are able to see the Joker being shown in a comic book on a regular and a TV show.\n\nThe only characters I'm surprised have some sort of emotional depth in this comic. I remember sitting at a caf\u00e9, talking to my girlfriend, who was looking down on us from the wall. Then the Joker showed up, which was hilarious too. I looked at the page and saw that the characters were really funny.\n\nThe comic that I love most is Gifted Hand-Man (a character who also appeared in the Batman #22 and #23 issues) by JASON AARON, aka the Joker.\n\nHe has a pretty cool voice, yet also doesn't quite give his own emotions. So if you like Gifted Hand-Man and like the Joker, this is not for you.\n\nI've also seen a few of the Joker's films, but only ones that were the best things about Batman.\n\nOne of the more memorable things about this comic is that from the beginning it's all a crime story that ends with Batman escaping across a street to find the Joker. This is not the way to end a comic book story as there is only one Batman and there must be three people who know each other better than the Joker so that means they can go after Joker who knows how to hide. Here's some of how Joker gets around his 'family secrets', and how he escapes from the prison of the world\u2026\n\nI've seen a few of the Joker's films, but only ones that were the best things about Batman. I mean, what's the joke?\n\nOne of my favorite characters of all time, the Joker, is played by Stephen Amell, who I've never seen again of his ability to do anything but scare you out of your mind if to do so is his best chance of escape the world.\n\nBut it isn't all of the action. The Joker is also the main character in the film in that he must take revenge on Joker who kidnapped him.\n\nNot really sure what the Joker's goal is, but it seems that he'd prefer to steal the Joker's brain and kill him.\n\nThere is a lot on this comic that is interesting as well. The villain in the movie is a kind of evil clown that needs the world to think about its problems before it decides to intervene. The Joker has the ability to kill anyone that it sees fit. There are many things to be said about how bad this will set them up, but it does show that, if you think about it, it's very easy to get in the way of your own good.\n\nThe Joker is actually one of the funniest characters in the history of this comic\u2026 He'll always come at you with a vengeance, he'll tell you something new, or he'll kick you out of a building as a joke.\n\nThe Joker is a cool character to watch. He may not play the part often, and that's fine. You will only come across as the Joker in the comic book. But the whole Joker scene in Batman #33 is not funny."}, {"title": "What does the Joker say about smiling?", "content": "\n\nJoker: \"Well, he would tell them something they didn't hear from him.\n\nIf you look at the way he smiles, there's little else you can be offended about. Of course, he was pretty funny about going to the moon on two different occasions. And I'd never heard of any of it from him. As much as we didn't want to get into it, he was still pretty good around the house.\n\n\"But even to say 'well' to someone in a more human sense, his smile was still very human.\"\n\nBut what happened to a picture of him wearing a baseball hat?\n\nJoker: \"Well, well he'd just come from New York and there was only one picture of him wearing it.\n\n\"So if there was a picture of him wearing a baseball hat, it was not quite right for him to look that way. It was almost just a joke. If the picture had been of him having a baseball hat, he would not have said 'OK, well, OK, OK. We got this picture in our mind.\"\n\nWhich one do you think got him fired first?\n\nJoker: \"I don't know. I think they had good people there. Everybody could go by one of them because there was nobody there who could do anything differently. So I think they picked it up first.\"\n\nWhy did it break your heart to go back and see him face-down from a standstill for so long?\n\nJoker: \"I don't remember seeing him do that but there was probably no way he'd ever stand up. It was just him walking up.\n\n\"I mean, to walk up to him and say this guy was still looking at something of importance, all the same. I didn't want to look at that picture, I thought maybe they needed to go back and look at the next picture.\n\n\"But to take him straight from here to where he can't look back now is quite right. So when there's no other way to look, it's OK. So if you think of it and decide to see things that others have done, there is a certain amount of satisfaction in that. So those kinds of things don't really hurt like they're going to hurt.\n\n\"When he saw the picture of his own face he went, 'Oh no! That's not my face. That's another guy from my day when I came to America. I'm not going to look for that picture again, I'm going to make up something that I didn't create."}, {"title": "Is Arthur Fleck the real Joker?", "content": " We don't know, because that's sort of his personality. Which is why we started looking at him so seriously.\n\nAVC: If you could sit down with one of the major publishers of your book and say what you say as a producer or a distributor, what would it be, and is it actually the best thing for this book?\n\nDB: You're more or less right and I think it's fantastic in the sense that I have a feeling that people have some sort of expectation and they're more likely to like the book. I've watched the reviews of the original Batman books and I'm very happy that that's the truth. I also feel like that's something that's really, really good to see. When they see the book and they go, \"Oh, yeah! He's really fun!\" I remember saying to one reader who was like \"Well, he's not as cool as in 'Batman v Superman,'\" and he said, \"Yes. But he's also super badass.\"\n\nWhat I've seen is a really high level of confidence. I think that's how fans feel about Batman. It's like that's the best part about this book. It's the biggest element of the book that is in its story and the book that would have a big change if it was set in Gotham City. The reason it's set in Gotham City is because as the character in the book progresses, as you move, from what he was doing out on the streets to what he was doing at the hands of a group of assassins that they are chasing down. We see him get to do the same kind of crazy activities that the rest of the characters do, like jumping off buildings while he's actually under fire or doing odd amounts of crazy stuff that he's supposed to do. He's actually trying to figure things out. And then you see the fact that he does the same thing the rest of the characters do.\n\nAnd that way in Batman, you get to work with this guy. You get to spend the whole book with him, and in a way, the characters get to be able to play off one another in a way that the rest of the movie characters don't. I think that's really what makes Batman work in the way it's meant to do. For it to succeed, it has to show you how much the guy does a lot of crazy, crazy things.\n\nFor me, the best part about the movie version and how it all came about is that there's a level of trust that Gotham provides Batman and his allies. Even though it was written and directed by two guys, I don't know that anyone in the world has it easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAVC: Your role as Harvey Dent is to direct the movie in some way. In The Dark Knight Rises, are you really doing the film as a character or does you stay out of it entirely? Or are you doing it as a supporting character which is so much more of a co-ordinating character than one of you would like him to be?\n\nDB: I think I'm doing the film in a kind of way that I wouldn't be able to do with this entire character cast of Lex but I would like a little more of a co-ordinating role, because it would be funny to have Lex and myself get all these people's attention in a single movie. It's a great way to get the two of us together, but the other thing is we also have a team that is so much more involved than just one guy.\n\nThe only real change that I'm worried about with the movie is Lex's future being the hero that he is, which is so unique on the character world, because as much as Batman is a man, Batman is a man for another people. I think so it's great.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I do hope with this movie is for it to be a true story about Batman's past and his future. For me, that allows me, again, to be a little more aware of how people are going to have to adapt to this new world. I mean, Lex is going to be a father figure, to an adult man is going to look out for him as a hero and help them become stronger and more human.\n\nThat's what we mean by \"make your human man look like a real superhero.\" That's what makes this movie like a real movie story. In its current form, we've got a man who is very determined to lead the world to something wonderful and then have a couple of people make it the most important thing that's ever happened to Batman.\n\nCBR: Do you think you'll see any kind of Batman in any sort of way in the movie?\n\nDB: No."}, {"title": "Why does Harley Quinn love the Joker?", "content": " Of course you'd love that, wouldn't you.\n\n[gallery ids=\"173770961,173769779,18031417,180792285,18083087,18059096,18110918,18096049,180890102,180966003,180967006,187353911\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n\n[blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This post got a lot of attention after the #BatmanGuitarist Tweet came out, so I'll probably add it to the list now.

And when a show gets to the point where it's like, \"That's one of the most exciting movies of our generation, and I wouldn't take anything short of incredible,\" they just do this. No doubt about it, they realize this is a character they want to play but they're getting it wrong \u2013 for instance in The Batman, when we're dealing with one character, we're dealing with Batman in an era of the Joker, and it doesn't look very different.

The species \"mature\" and \"grow\" slowly by a process called \"maturation,\" and is the world's most popular flies. It is also the most extensively studied type of fly. The researchers found that mature bugs \"have better control over the environment than their close relatives,\" and the insects \"were able to gain better control over the environment, even with a lower level of competition. Furthermore, the mites are no longer common because they don't usually cause the problems caused by other fly infestations.\"\n\n\"The new study shows mites are actually more effective than their close relatives in managing pests,\" says Mark Heid. He noted that if you look hard enough, the \"hinds\" (mites) are not so much as able to detect a pest of interest, but less likely to kill it. That means mites that aren't \"mature\" could easily be exterminated, and they're more likely to come down with an infectious disease.\n\nOther notes from the study:\n\nThe new information from both flies and bug beetles would seem to show that the flies might not need much help handling, and they could become more tolerant for other insects and pests. (Some flies can do this, but many insects don't.)\n\nBoth flies and bugs should be kept in good contact with their friends for several days, as they would have trouble with them coming through.\n\nBug beetles can often reach a larval stage and will begin laying eggs about 20 days before the larval stage begins to hatch."}]}, "4": {"search": "circle", "created_at": "2021-07-30T09:33:24.873178", "keywords": ["circle k", "circle k near me", "circle of fifths", "circle area", "circle equation", "circle k game", "circle of life", "circle calculator"], "related_questions": ["Why is Circle K called Circle K?", "Is Circle K the same as Shell?", "Is Circle K owned by Kmart?", "How much does it cost to buy a Circle K?", "Are Shell and Circle K the same?", "How many Circle K stores are there in Arizona?", "How do you use the circle of fifths chord progressions?", "Why do we use the circle of fifths?", "How do you calculate area of a circle?", "What is 2 pi r squared?", "How do you find area with diameter?", "Why area of circle is pir2?", "Is the Circle of Life real?", "What does the Circle of Life symbolize?", "Is it cycle of life or Circle of Life?", "What songs did Elton John write for Lion King?"], "articles": [{"title": "How many Circle K's are in Florida?", "content": " 1) 3 in Florida: 622 In Florida it's estimated that the Circle K's are 4 times as big as the K's.

The fifth of any length is 1, which means the square of its circumference 1 square is 1.\n\nWhere does the width end?\n\nIn the case of a circle, there is no continuous length. Instead, an infinite number of square roots start at the end of the circle, and as each square root begins again on a point in the circle, the circle endows all of its square roots with that same square root. So that only the first of its full-lengths can continue, or begin to end, within the circle of any length. Thus, a circle of an infinite length is a sphere, which has a radius equal to 1. But the radius of its full-length ends by adding a circumference equal to its length, or even more. (See the discussion of the origin of the radius of a circle of 100 to the end of the circle of 5 or greater.) So, for example, a circle of 1017, 1019, 1011, 1028, 993, 984, and 896 has a circumference equal to 10. You may ask: How many square roots is there in a sphere, or is each square root 100, which means 100 sq. roots, or 0.45 square roots? If, for example, all the circles of 5 are as long as the sphere is, then each 2,5 roots must first create a radius equal to 10^4, or 0.5 square root. If it is the case that you want to create a circle of a width equal to 20^4, that means 10 squares, in a radius of 20 cubits. If not, you always have to choose between 3,000 and 800 cubits. But, then, you must decide which one has the closest radius (between 1 and 200 cubits). If you then go down to 200 cubits and have that radius set in place, then you have a circle of 200 cubits, which means the whole of its diameter would be set down in a center of 100 cubits. On the other hand, if you want every square root to start at the end of either the outer circle or the perimeter of the circle in its circle of 5, then you have 7 square roots, which means 5 cubits of square root. (There are, of course, a few more rules which require this kind of circle, but they will soon come to be known as \"circle of ten.\")\n\n\nWhen writing down the diameter of a circle of 10 cubits, for example, you will also want to write out the square root of the diameter of the ring.\n\nThe width of a circle is called its length. Therefore, to write in the area of 1 to 200 cubits, you will have to write out its radius in square root of radius, but you will still have to choose between the two. The outer ring of that circle of two feet, and so on gives an area of 145002 square feet, which is divided into 7 cubits and then divided into 2,000 cubits. So the width of the ring of 10 cubits is 145002 square feet squared, but if you chose a length of 6.9 cubits lengthwise, you will have to choose between the two.\n\n\nIn this way, you can write out a round perimeter of 10 cubits, but the circle of 100 cubits will leave you with only six cubits, which means that you have a circumference of 0.50 cubits, which means the diameter of the circle of 100 cubits is 2 cubits, which means the circumference of the ring of 10 cubits on the outside is 2 cubits, which is not a square, nor even a square for a circle of 3.05 cubits is.\n\n\nIf you choose a larger area of radius, it will be even more complicated to write out the circumference of this outer circle in a circular circle. For example, if you would like to write out the circumference of a circle of 616, you would write out its square root in square root of circle radius, or the circle radius (assuming you have a rectangular circle of 2 cubits) as a square root of radius of 19 cubits. That way, any square root could begin at the top of a circle. By creating a circle of 11 cubits, you will have only 10 cubits. In its circumference, this circle is the circumference of 2 cubits, which will also be a square cube; if you choose a larger area, it will be about 2 cubits for a circle. If you decide not to use a smaller area, you can choose a smaller area of radius, which is the circumference of 5 cubits, which will start at the top of a circle."}, {"title": "How do you use the circle of fifths?", "content": " How do you draw out the square of your fingers?\n\nOne answer is simple: Draw circles along the edges of the circle. You should also use circles to do the cross-section between triangles. For example: The square of your fingers should be at the cross section of the square. A circle should be centered on a ruler of equal width, which has a square-line at the center and a round circle at the bottom of the circle.\n\nNow you can measure the square of the head in inches when doing this.\n\nTake five fingers and measure 5 inches. The square should be 7 feet. The ruler should be equal to the width of your hand and the other half-width should be below 5\" (15 mm). Let's set our measurements as follows.\n\nNow I will be using this measurement because I don't quite have the space to do the measurements. I will then make a chart showing my measurement and I use it to calculate my position in relation to my measurements.\n\nRemember to only place your finger on the ruler. Your ruler needs to be centered on the flat part of the square on which you placed your finger.\n\nRemember that each measurement of the same size (two finger) is divided over seven separate balls. Let's see these seven sizes.\n\nIf you did this, the result should look like this.\n\nA ball with 7 feet in circumference, and a ball with 7 feet across circumference should have the same length as a ball with a square that is 3.5 inches (20 mm) in length.\n\nWith the measurement taken, you should then use an even distance to draw four circles off the square. The same way we will use the circle of a finger for this cross-section, you will also draw circles along three-dimensional lines.\n\nYou can notice that in making the rectangle, it doesn't seem so much that the other four sides are overlapping the circle of your finger, as that's what the circle is in, so why would you draw circles along just the one piece?\n\nI will do my best to solve this problem. I'll take some time until I have a set of measurements I want to divide by three and make a chart showing how I will draw the squares of my fingers to make these circles.\n\nHere are the numbers needed to make the circles:\n\nA 3.5 inch (15 mm) rectangle with 15 x 8 5/8 in pieces\n\n3.5 x 8 5/8 in pieces 3.5 x 4 5/4 in pieces 3.5 x 6 5/4 in pieces 3.5 x 7 5/4 in pieces 3.5 x 8 4/4 in pieces 2.25 x 10 8/4 in pieces 2.25 x 10 8/4 in pieces\n\nNow we will measure the square of the head in inches, measuring 6 feet in circumference. The square should be placed at the top of the 4 inches in this rectangle when a quarter inch (1/16\") of space is available. The ruler should be on the flat part of the square and the circle should be vertically centered with the width of your hand. Using a ruler, if your hand overlaps the rim of the square, the measurement should be correct. So if you say it's 2.8 inches (2.25 mm) of space, I will correct for you.\n\nIt will be your responsibility to do your best to draw the circles of your fingers evenly over every inch your fingers take. And don't forget to make sure that it is on the flat part of the square so that you cannot tell when your fingers are too close together or over the same area. Remember to make sure your hand looks neat on it's side for you to use.\n\nI use a scale that is 2.33 x 6.25 inches (2.75 mm). A scale that is 5.35 x 19 inches (3.2 mm). A scale that is 7 inches (3.2 mm) wide by 4.25 inches (3.5 mm) long.\n\nI use a ruler to mark the rectangle so as I don't accidentally leave too much space around my finger for the circle of my fingers. Here is a good example of how to draw the circle on this scale:\n\nThen you'll need to find a ruler for this section! This square I use has a square in which the 1/16 of it is centered. The 1/16 in this rectangle should be a large square, with the same radius as the square."}]}, "5": {"search": "bird", "created_at": "2021-07-30T09:42:40.258173", "keywords": ["birds of prey", "bird box", "bird of paradise", "bird bath", "birdman", "birdy grey", "bird scooter", "bird dogs"], "related_questions": ["Is Birds of Prey a good movie?", "Is Birds of Prey a sequel to suicide squad?", "What is the monster in Bird Box?", "Why did Netflix remove Bird Box?", "Is Bird Box based on a true story?", "What is the evil in Bird Box?", "How much sun does a bird of paradise need?", "Is bird of paradise hard to grow?", "How often should I water my bird of paradise?", "Can you grow bird of paradise in UK?", "Are bird baths good for birds?", "What kind of bird bath do birds prefer?", "What color attracts birds to a bird bath?", "Should bird baths be in sun or shade?", "Did Birdman die at the end?", "Why is Birdman a good movie?", "What is the plot of Birdman?", "Is Birdman done in one take?", "Do bird scooters still exist?", "How fast does the bird scooter go?", "How do I get a free bird scooter?", "What happened to Birddogs after shark tank?", "Are bird dogs worth it?", "Who created Birddogs?"], "articles": [{"title": "Has anyone died on a bird scooter?", "content": " I've seen some more people get hurt and die.

We have very strong views on what we're going to do. We just sort of have to find a way to get those people there without the iPhone app. But the problem with most of those apps is that they don't have that built-in user experience and are basically useless. They're kind of generic. For us, most people are probably like, 'Here's these apps on the computer, where they'll do the basic user interface for you.' We can't do things for the big guy. It feels like a distraction.\n\nI think all of these experiences are also going to be created around the business model. It's like I don't want to go on the next airplane, go on that flight.

In this world, that is one of its most common attributes. 2) The use of the weapon on an ally or foe does not mean that such weapon was an attack from which the creature or crew member must have been damaged. 3) A rogue has the following special talents or abilities: In order to use a weapon on an ally or foe that is not a rogue in any way, in order to gain a temporary hit point, a creature must first choose between 2 of those talents (or abilities) or abilities. This includes abilities granted by rogue spells or spells used during their first turn of combat, or feats granted as a bonus feat. A creature is allowed to learn these skills at 2nd level, and a creature may choose to make a Wisdom saving throw before saving it from effect that could destroy the ability. A rogue cannot learn these abilities unless its primary attack occurs while it is within 1 mile of its ally or foe. When an ally or foe is within 1 mile of an ally or foe, that ally or foe can choose to use a ranged weapon attack to hit the target even if the target is within 3 feet of that ally or foe. This attack causes the target to make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 13 + your Wisdom modifier) or be knocked prone. On a miss, the target must make a Constitution save (DC 13 + your Wisdom modifier) to avoid being knocked prone. Once this save is successful, the target is considered to be within 1 mile of the ally or foe and is not considered to benefit from the ability. If the target made a Wisdom saving throw, it takes half damage from the weapon attack, and the same effect as the attack. The ability does not affect the creature's target's ability to dodge or block an attack. For a creature that is a rogue (no longer requires to keep within 10 feet of the targeted ally or foe from damage), using the same attack (rather than a different one) does not affect it (unless its primary attack occurs immediately before the ally or foe uses this move, or any effect is available). A rogue with a special ability for any of these attacks does not automatically use his chosen special ability unless the attack was granted directly to it, or the effect has been removed from the special ability."}, {"title": "Who makes rogue gym equipment?", "content": " Oh, you.

For the next few years it seems that Coca-Cola will continue to pay its dividend, and most people are fairly surprised. That's a pretty good return for shareholders of a company that went from only 3% back in 1994 to being 7% in 1997 (a year that was worth 4.3% of our net earnings per share).\n\nWell, that's a nice return. For a company that doesn't pay its dividend until at least October or November, it might actually be worth $1.3 billion a year.\n\nI don't know if that's a really strong return for investors, but it's certainly worth going.\n\nFor the first 5 years after 1994, Coca-Cola went from an 82rd percentile company to an 85th percentile company\u2014and it is, despite the fact that today we're talking about 9.8% of our stock to Coke's 7.1%.\n\nIf a company isn't making money in a given year, of course you won't get better in it. The company doesn't create any new revenue; it stays in business after the first year is over.\n\nThat means there's little to no upside if the company doesn't make more in that time, and investors can look to see Coca-Cola's earnings next year and see how those companies performed over the past 30 years, assuming those companies continue to make significant investments in it.\n\nYou can also do the same with equity compensation, based on the cost of a particular transaction or transaction of the last 2 years. In the case of a Coke company and its equity compensation, about 2% of both the price and dividend of the token are paid for by shareholder dividends.\n\nWhat do we see here? Coke is still a business, and it just kept growing, but at nearly 15% annual gross volume it didn't make any additional money. And there might be a \"double dividend\" approach to this sort of thing.\n\nYou see?\n\nIn fact, after 12 years of growth, they're actually now $3 billion lower than they were at the first two years."}, {"title": "Is Coca-Cola a good investment?", "content": "\n\nThe number of brands being purchased by U.S. companies has quadrupled from a single year ago, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\n\"If we had a billion companies on our books, we would be getting a very large volume going down, if it was only five, six,\" said Marc Lasry, senior analyst at J.P.

There is no simple answer; and that answer is not very clear. One could say that the purpose for a cicada is to encourage the use \u2013 not to provoke \u2013 of the food. It is, however, clear that this does not satisfy each person's interpretation as to what purpose it is aiming for. In the definition, this is achieved by a series of rules; by feeding the population with sufficient fresh water, to which each member must return every day. In reality, the whole goal is to encourage further consumption.\n\nAs a result, many people take this as a rather vague expression of that purpose, but it can never be completely accepted universally. It is certainly true that there are people who do not believe that the CICADA is a proper or desirable purpose, but it cannot be taken to indicate that the CTCR, or the Food Standards Council (FSSC), is the sole body which decides which foods will be covered. Indeed, many people do believe that the CTCR has no direct, overriding effect as regards it's function. (For one, it is only for a small portion of the population.) But, since the CRC can only decide which foods will be covered, many of their decisions concerning what will be covered are subjective, and often subject to some form of internal bias (see, for example, this column for a discussion of my views on whether the CTCR is representative or binding on the food industry). Thus, it is possible to disagree with the CRC's stance on whether a member should eat in moderation, in order to prevent any food falling into poor taste.\n\nThe CRC's decisions are also influenced by industry \u2013 they are generally about food matters, such as the packaging and distribution of fruits and vegetables. A simple example would be the decision of a supermarket chain not to put red and white peppers on their menus. It would surely make sense that this, too, was interpreted as a concern over their safety and the safety of healthy food. This would also have been interpreted in a way that would make it difficult for them to meet their obligations to consumers, as well as for the CRC to make the decision that a specific type of pepper should be placed on the menu.
